    <p>
      In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software.Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders like client, user, manager, or development team.

  User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context.

    <h3>History</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
      <li>1999: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game</li>
      <li>
        2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation
        <ul>
          <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts</li>
          <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation</li>
          <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>2001: The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.
  </li>
      <li>2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention</li>
      <li>2014: After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence</li>
