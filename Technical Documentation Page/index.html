          <p>In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software.[1] Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders like client, user, manager, or development team.</p>
          <p>User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context.</p>
          <p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.</p>

          function sectionName(sectName) {

          sectionName("Usage");

          <p>As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user stories describe what may be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.</p>
          <p>When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.</p>
          <p>User stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.</p>
          <h3>Acceptance criteria</h3>
          <p>Mike Cohn defines acceptance criteria as "notes about what the story must do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete."[19] They define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended.</p>
          <p>The appropriate amount of information to be included in the acceptance criteria varies by team, program and project. Some may include 'predecessor criteria', "The user has already logged in and has already edited his information once".[This quote needs a citation] Some may write the acceptance criteria in typical agile format, Given-When-Then. Others may simply use bullet points taken from original requirements gathered from customers or stakeholders.</p>
            <p>In order for a story to be considered done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.</p>

        <code>
          function sectionName(sectName) {

          sectionName("Benefits");

          <p>There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which is linked to success.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Relationship">
        <header >
          <h2>Relationship</h2>
        </header>
        <code>
          function sectionName(sectName) { 
          alert("This is " + sectName); 
          }<br>
          sectionName("Relationship");
        </code>
          <p>In many contexts, user stories are used and also summarized in groups for semantic and organizational reasons. The different usages depend on the point-of-view, e.g. either looking from a user perspective as product owner in relation to features or a company perspective in relation to task organization.</p>
          <p>While some suggest to use 'epic' and 'theme' as labels for any thinkable kind of grouping of user stories, organization management tends to use it for strong structuring and uniting work loads. For instance, Jira seems to use a hierarchically organized to-do-list, in which they named the first level of to-do-tasks 'user-story', the second level 'epics' ( grouping of user stories ) and the third level 'initiatives' ( grouping of epics ). However, initiatives are not always present in product management development and just add another level of granularity. In Jira, 'themes' exist ( for tracking purposes ) that allow to cross-relate and group items of different parts of the fixed hierarchy.</p>
        <p>In this usage, Jira shifts the meaning of themes in an organization perspective: e.g how much time did we spent on developing theme "xyz". But another definition of themes is: a set of stories, epics, features etc for a user that forms a common semantic unit or goal. There is probably not a common definition because different approaches exist for different styles of product design and development. In this sense, some also suggest to not use any kind of hard groups and hierarchies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Epic</li>
          <li>Initiative</li>
          <li>Theme</li>
        </ul>

          sectionName("Story");

        <p>A story map[31] organises user stories according to a narrative flow that presents the big picture of the product. The technique was developed by Jeff Patton from 2005 to 2014 to address the risk of projects flooded with very detailed user stories that distract from realizing the product's main objectives.</p>

          function sectionName(sectName) {

          sectionName("Journey");
        </code>
        <p>A user journey map[36] intends to show the big picture but for a single user category. Its narrative line focuses on the chronology of phases and actions that a single user has to perform in order to achieve his or her objectives.

This allows to map the user experience beyond a set of user stories. Based on user feedback, the positive and negative emotions can be identified across the journey. Points of friction or unfulfilled needs can be identified on the map. This technique is used to improve the design of a product,[37] allowing to engage users in participatory approaches.</p>
